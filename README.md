Running a1.py runs a full model training and spits out the plot for the loss over epochs, boundary line and confusion matrix. The print statements for the other information gathering tasks have disappeared over the iterations arriving at this final solution.

Install numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn, then run with
```sh
python a1.py
```
